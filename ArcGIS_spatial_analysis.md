# Spatial Analysis in ArcGIS
# 1. Average Nearest Neighbor
  Calculates a nearest neighbor index based on the average distance from each feature to its nearest neighboring feature.The Nearest Neighbor Index is expressed as the ratio of the Observed Mean Distance to the Expected Mean Distance. The expected distance is the average distance between neighbors in a hypothetical random distribution. If the index is less than 1, the pattern exhibits clustering; if the index is greater than 1, the trend is toward dispersion or competition.
